/*!
 Called when tunnel is started to get the library consumer's desired configuration.

 Required fields:
 - `PropagationChannelId`
 - `SponsorId`
 - Remote server list functionality is not strictly required, but absence greatly undermines circumvention ability.
   - `RemoteServerListUrl`
   - `RemoteServerListSignaturePublicKey`
 - Obfuscated server list functionality is also not strictly required, but aids circumvention ability.
   - `ObfuscatedServerListRootURL`

 Optional fields (if you don't need them, don't set them):
 - `DataStoreDirectory`: If not set, the library will use a sane location. Override if the client wants to restrict where operational data is kept. If overridden, the directory must already exist and be writable.
 - `RemoteServerListDownloadFilename`: If not set, the library will use a sane location. Override if the client wants to restrict where operational data is kept.
 - `ObfuscatedServerListDownloadDirectory`: If not set, the library will use a sane location. Override if the client wants to restrict where operational data is kept. If overridden, the directory must already exist and be writable.
 - `ClientPlatform`: Should not be set by most library consumers.
 - `UpstreamProxyUrl`
 - `EmitDiagnosticNotices`
 - `LocalHttpProxyPort` // TODO: Should this be set-able for iOS?
 - `LocalSocksProxyPort` // TODO: Should this be set-able for iOS?
 - `EgressRegion`
 - `EstablishTunnelTimeoutSeconds`
 - `TunnelWholeDevice`: For stats purposes, but must be accurate. Defaults to 0 (false).
 - Should only be set if the Psiphon library is handling upgrade downloading (which it usually is _not_):
   - `UpgradeDownloadUrl`
   - `UpgradeDownloadClientVersionHeader`
   - `UpgradeDownloadFilename`
 - Only set if disabling timeouts (for very slow network connections):
   - `TunnelConnectTimeoutSeconds`
   - `TunnelPortForwardDialTimeoutSeconds`
   - `TunnelSshKeepAliveProbeTimeoutSeconds`
   - `TunnelSshKeepAlivePeriodicTimeoutSeconds`
   - `FetchRemoteServerListTimeoutSeconds`
   - `PsiphonApiServerTimeoutSeconds`
   - `FetchRoutesTimeoutSeconds`
   - `HttpProxyOriginServerTimeoutSeconds`
